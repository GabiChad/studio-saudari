<h1>Poetry from the Indian Ocean / African Islands</h1>
<h2 class="header-text">
Finding Stephen Gray’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14937063-invitation-to-a-voyage">Invitation to a Voyage: French - Language Poetry of the Indian Ocean African Islands (2008)</a> was akin to unearthing a gem; a glimmering glow beneath the dust of the recent. This anthology, so carefully curated and translated, presents poetic offerings from a diverse range of wordsmiths whose thoughts and observations draw you in a cocoon of relation, a plethora of childhood nostalgia meets contemporary social woe, amorous longing clashing against the waves of foreign-soiled urban displacement. 
<br>
<br>
Comprising of six chapters, each section covers a region of the Indian Ocean Islands - Mauritius, Madagascar, Seychelles, Reunion,  Mayotte and Comoros - showcasing a collection of works that meticulously covers personal experiences within each area. Moving past the exclusive bounds of notches in the proverbial belt of published material, some of the poets presented have had none of their work published before, allowing for a welcomed breath of novelty in style.
<br>
<br>
Here are just a few of the poems one can find in this invigorating anthology:

A Poem Reflecting My Life
</h2>
<h3>
Veromanitra Razafiarivony
</h3>
<p>
    <br>
    When I take the decision
<br>
    Not to follow you in that far country
  <br>  
    with its wealthy sweet ways,
 <br>   
    I still love you more than my life,
   <br> 
    But I’m afraid of being cut off
  <br>
    In such a spectacular world.
    <br>
    That valley of silver would prevent me
    <br>
    From visiting Rosoanilaina whom I need so much,
    <br>
    She who dresses my hair in Marina tresses,
    <br>
    So easy to do and which honour me
    <br>
    like a lady with a newborn child.
    <br>
    <br>
    And now, so our parting begins
    <br>
    You leave for gain and I leave for life,
    <br>
    Your courtesy is not enough to live Malgache-style
    <br>
    I grind the rice; I plant the paddy;
    <br>
    With pistachio I cook the cassava.
    <br>
    I die losing you. You’re off to your fate,
    <br>
    To plant yourself anew on the soil of sweat,
    <br>
    Foreign soil where I’d never find
    <br>
    My own sense of belonging,
    <br>
    My negress skin, my frizzy hair,
    <br>
    My beauty would would wither away in that
    <br>
    land of riches.

        He was Called Ali

    <p>
        <br>
        and he wasn’t taller than three apples
<br>
        juicy ones
        <br>
        exactly as they should be
        <br>
        to give taste to life
        <br>
        he was no higher
        <br>
        than three fruit
        <br>
        plucked from the tree of paradise
        <br>
        to make heads turn
        <br>
        such that life tasted of cider
        <br>
        he wasn’t tall enough
        <br>
        too much of a child
        <br>
        to be making war
        <br>
        but still they involved him
        <br>
        in their warrior games
        <br>
        now there are gaps 
        <br>
        in the apples
        <br>
        because they dared to trample
        <br>
        over God’s orchard!
        <br>
        the innocence of childhood!

        My Somali
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Kamaroudine Abdallah Paune
        </h3>
        <p>
<br>
Of this world you are the witness,
<br>
From the dust you question
<br>
The sphere of the sky
<br>
Limbs stripped of flesh,
<br>
on the edge of nothingness,
<br>
what image will you keep
<br>
of men, your brothers?
<br>
<br>
My Somali, fortunately
<br>
you cannot see yourself through
<br>
the television watching you. 
<br>
<br>
Fortunately you are unaware of 
<br>
This world,
<br>
Neither can you hear the laughter
<br>
Over the dinner table and wine
<br>
Nor the excellent discourse 
<br>
Which constructs a life over the tomb.
<br>
<br>
For you none of that exists,
<br>
Nothing but that land cursed
<br>
By the sun and the rain,
<br>
That soil once blessed by the god
<br>
And today beyond the hope of man.
<br>
<br>
Perish, my brother,
<br>
Perish without regret,
<br>
Die in peace,
<br>
The world is so.

Agree to look.
